## Assessment types

- **MCQ** (Multiple Choice Questions): Short, focused questions with 1 correct, 1 absurd, and 2 deceptive answers. See `assessments/mcq/`.
- **Open Questions**: Open-ended, design, or reasoning questions. See `assessments/open-questions/`.
- **Problem Solving**: Step-by-step technical or algorithmic problems. See `assessments/problem-solving/`.

## Practice flow (start here)
1. Pick a topic from [topics/_index.md](../topics/_index.md).
2. Do 1 MCQ (4–5 min) + 1 open/design (8–12 min) + 1 problem-solving (optional, 10–20 min).
3. Answer in BLUF: definition → decision rules → trade-offs → example → failure mode.
4. Score with Prompt C and get a targeted trap question.
