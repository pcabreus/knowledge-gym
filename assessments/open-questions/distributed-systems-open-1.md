Q2) How do you reason about consistency models (at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once) when designing a distributed workflow that updates billing records?
Q3) Describe how timeouts and circuit breakers work together to protect a system from slow downstream dependencies.
Q4) When scaling a consumer pipeline from 100 to 5,000 events/sec, what are the top 5 things you would validate and change first?
Q5) Explain partitioning (sharding) vs replication: goals, trade-offs, and how you would choose sharding keys for a multi-tenant dataset.
Q6) What are the observable signals you would monitor to detect an emerging split-brain or partition-induced inconsistency in a cluster?
Q7) Trap question: "Exactly-once" semantics appear in marketing materials — what do interviewers mean and what should your practical answer be?
