Knowledge Gym is a system to:
- Capture technical knowledge with a uniform structure.
- Turn it into deep understanding (decision rules, trade-offs, failure modes).
- Keep it alive over time (practice and review).

Central principle:
**No duplication**. If one concept depends on another, link it.

End result:
Be able to explain any topic in “teacher mode”: what it is, why it matters, when, when not, alternatives, trade-offs, example, and traps.
