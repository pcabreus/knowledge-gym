# Taxonomy (categories)

## Topics
Suggested location for topics:
- `topics/go/` (Go language: concurrency (goroutines/channels), context (context.Context), testing, pprof)
- `topics/system-design/` (API design, caching, rate limiting, backpressure, load balancing)
- `topics/database/` (PostgreSQL, indexes, JSONB, transactions, ACID, CAP)
- `topics/security/` (authentication vs authorization, JWT, hashing, encryption)
- `topics/architecture/` (event-driven, CQRS, event sourcing, hexagonal, DDD)
- `topics/operations/` (observability, SLI/SLO, runbooks, incident response)
- `topics/quality/` (code quality, testing pyramid, clean code, quality gates, SQA)
- `topics/interviews/` (behavioural, leadership, case stories)

## Assessments
All assessments are in the `assessments/` folder, grouped by type:
- `assessments/mcq/` (Multiple Choice Questions)
- `assessments/open-questions/` (Open and design questions)
- `assessments/problem-solving/` (Algorithmic and technical problems)

Rule: if in doubt, place it where it's most likely to be found. Refactor later without changing the canonical (or keep an alias).
