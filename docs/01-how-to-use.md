# How to use this repo

1) Browse `topics/_index.md` to find topics by category.
2) Read the topic and follow links to prerequisites.
3) Practice with the topic’s own questions (“Trap questions” section) or with `questions/`.
4) When a new topic appears (interview/project), create a new topic with Prompt A (see `docs/06-prompts.md`).
