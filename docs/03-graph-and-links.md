# Graph and links

## Goal
Make knowledge navigable as a graph:
- prerequisites → to learn in order
- related → to compare and decide
- part-of → to place it in a taxonomy

## Recommended pattern
- Each topic includes:
  - Prerequisites (links)
  - Related (links)
  - “Compare with” (links)

## Aliases
- `topics/_aliases/<alias>.md` contains:
  - a single line pointing to the canonical

Example:
`topics/_aliases/gin.md` → `../database/gin-index.md`
